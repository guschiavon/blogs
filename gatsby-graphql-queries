# Gatsby GraphQL Queries

## Overview

As the official GraphQL documentation states: 
> GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data.

## Nomenclature

- `edges`: an array of records. Provide flexibility to use your data. Think of it as a collection of 
- `node`: a record containing data, or pure data. Can be a single blog post, a product item, an author... Nodes are nested edges.

### Common queries

- `allMarkdownRemark`: returns all the Markdown files from the project 

### Iterate over arrays with React

It is necessary to map the array in order to return the values for each individual array item. for this we use the `map` function.
